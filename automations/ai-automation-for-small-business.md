3.  **Choose the Right Tools:** Evaluate options (no-code, low-code, specific tools) based on the task, budget, and technical skill. Use free trials.
4.  **Involve the Team:** Communicate the benefits, train employees on how to use the new tools and processes, and gather feedback. Automation should empower, not frighten.
5.  **Measure Results:** Define clear KPIs (time saved, errors reduced, etc.) to evaluate the impact of automation and justify future investments.
6.  **Iterate and Scale:** Automation is an ongoing process. Monitor, adjust, and gradually expand automations to other business areas as you gain confidence and see results.
